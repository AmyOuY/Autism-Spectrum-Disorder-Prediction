# Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction

<ul>
  <li>Applied data mining techniques to predict Autism based on behavioral symptoms</li>
  <li>Performed feature selection, algorithm selection, cross validation, parameter tuning and association rule mining on a dataset of 21 attributes using Python Scikit-Learn and RapidMiner</li> 
  <li>Built Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, FNN and KNN models to predict Autism using 14 selected features, with all models achieved over 0.91 accuracy</li> 
  <li>Identified the 4 most informative features that contributed over 0.81 accuracy to all models, suggesting that impairments in communication and social interaction are the core symptoms of Autism</li> 
</ul>
